## Principles
 - Principle #1: As soon as a comparable toolkit control or a service is available in official SDK, we will plan to mark it as deprecated
 - Principle #2: We want to keep the toolkit useful and not bloated with too specific services that will become hard to maintain
 - Principle #3: All controls / services are supported for 2 Windows SDK release cycles or until another Principle supersedes it.
