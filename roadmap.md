* **Controls**
 * HamburgerMenu
 * Carousel
 * Gauge
 * ResponsiveGridView: *The ResponsiveGridView control allows to present information within a Grid View perfectly adjusting the total display available space. It reacts to changes in the layout as well as the content so it can adapt to different form factors automatically. The number and the width of items are calculated based on the screen resolution in order to fully leverage the available screen space. The property ItemsHeight define the items fixed height and the property DesiredWidth sets the minimum width for the elements to add a new column*
 * VariableSizedGridView: The VariableSizedGridView control allows to display items from a list using different values for Width and Height item properties. You can control the number of rows and columns to be displayed as well as the items orientation in the panel. Finally, the AspectRatio property allow us to control the relation between Width and Height*
 * RangeSelector: *The RangeSlector is a double slider control for range values*
 * ImageEx: *The ImageEx control extends the default Image platform control improving the performance and responsiveness of your Apps. Source images are downloaded asynchronously showing a load indicator while in progress. Once downloaded, the source image is stored in the App local cache to preserve resources and load time next time the image needs to be displayed*
